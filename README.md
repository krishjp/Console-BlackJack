# Console-BlackJack
A basic Black Jack game that can be run through a device's terminal or an IDE's console

Continue to "Hit" until you beleive you have a higher number than the dealer!
However, be careful not to go over 21. This will result in an immediate bust.
Have fun playing this iconic, yet simple, game through your device's terminal/ IDE's console
